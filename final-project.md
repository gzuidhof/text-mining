#### Dataset
The dataset consists of 15,000 legal documents retrieved from *www.rechtspraak.nl* (governmental repository of court verdicts), provided in a structured format (XML) by *Legal Intelligence*. These documents contain various meta-data, including the law area(s), which is the ground truth.

#### Research Question

**To which extent can the law area(s) of a plain text verdict be predicted?**

#### Approach

##### Preprocessing
The first is preprocessing of the verdict files. From these the 'pure text' verdict and the labels have to be extracted.

This text will then be tokenized. I plan on using the *Frog* NLP module software package for tokenizing. Initially this is all the preprocessing that will be performed. If time permits, I will also look into lemmatizing and stop word removal  to improve classification performance (which I presume it will, as it decreases the vector space and sparseness).

##### Classification and validation
One document can entail multiple law areas which makes this a multi-label classification problem. I plan on using inductive methods only.

I plan on constructing a binary classifier for each of the labels which outputs the probability of the document being of a certain law area (such as Na√Øve Bayes). A probability cut-off value for assigning each of the labels can then be optimized using the test set (note: not the validation set). If this approach performs poorly, I will look into more specialized multi-label classification methods.

Validation will be performed on the held-out validation set, using a metric such as the *Hamming loss*.
